<p align="center">
  <em>Secure and simple file transfer with Python</em>
</p>

---

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Ensures files are securely transmitted and unreadable by anyone intercepting them.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrity Verification:</strong> Confirms that files arrive without corruption or tampering.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight and Simple:</strong> Minimal dependencies and straightforward setup for quick deployment.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Runs on any system with Python installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Philosophy</h2>
<p>In an era where digital communication is often vulnerable, <strong>CipherDrop</strong> is built with three guiding principles:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Your files are yours alone. Encryption ensures only the intended recipient can access them.</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity Without Sacrifice:</strong> Security doesn't have to be complex. CipherDrop keeps the interface intuitive while maintaining strong protection.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust Through Transparency:</strong> Open-source by design, allowing anyone to inspect, improve, or audit the code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Contributors are encouraged to participate not just to enhance CipherDrop, but to uphold the broader philosophy of <strong>free and open-source software</strong>. By contributing, you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help advance secure file sharing practices and cryptographic experimentation.</li>
  <li>Support a culture of transparency and reproducibility in software development.</li>
  <li>Gain hands-on experience with real-world encryption, networking, and cross-platform Python development.</li>
  <li>Join a community that values accessibility, collaboration, and ethical use of technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>CipherDrop embodies the belief that secure file sharing should be <strong>accessible, reliable, transparent, and a shared effort</strong>—inviting programmers, security researchers, and enthusiasts alike to contribute, learn, and innovate together.</p>
